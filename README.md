## Objectives

- Download assembled genomes of strains of *Streptomyces coelicolor* species, as well as its parent taxons *Streptomyces* (genus) and *Streptomycetaceae* (family).
- Filter strains by their quality of genome assembly.
- Find biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the genomes of filtered strains.
- Determine pangenome closeness/openness of selected BGCs.
- Identify a single instance of a molecular clock.
- Identify a single instance of horizontal gene transfer.
