               determination is best made with the combined phylogeny of
               protein-coding genes such as elongation factor (TEF1), RNA

               methods are in use to define species and to discover hitherto

  abstract  = "Abstract Motivation: Recent advances in single molecule
               real-time (SMRT) and nanopore sequencing technologies have
               enabled high-quality assemblies from long and inaccurate reads.
               However, these approaches require high coverage by long reads
               and remain expensive. On the other hand, the inexpensive short
               reads technologies produce accurate but fragmented assemblies.
               Thus, a hybrid approach that assembles long reads (with low
               coverage) and short reads has a potential to generate
               high-quality assemblies at reduced cost. Results: We describe
               hybridSPAdes algorithm for assembling short and long reads and
               benchmark it on a variety of bacterial assembly projects. Our
               results demonstrate that hybridSPAdes generates accurate
               assemblies (even in projects with relatively low coverage by
               long reads) thus reducing the overall cost of genome sequencing.
               We further present the first complete assembly of a genome from
               single cells using SMRT reads. Availability and implementation:
               hybridSPAdes is implemented in C++ as a part of SPAdes genome

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: We benchmarked the hybrid assembly approaches of
               MaSuRCA, SPAdes, and Unicycler for bacterial pathogens using
               Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing by determining genome
               completeness and accuracy, antimicrobial resistance (AMR),
               virulence potential, multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
               phylogeny, and pan genome. Ten bacterial species (10 strains)
               were tested for simulated reads of both mediocre- and
               low-quality, whereas 11 bacterial species (12 strains) were
               tested for real reads. RESULTS: Unicycler performed the best for
               achieving contiguous genomes, closely followed by MaSuRCA, while
               all SPAdes assemblies were incomplete. MaSuRCA was less tolerant
               of low-quality long reads than SPAdes and Unicycler. The hybrid
               assemblies of five antimicrobial-resistant strains with
               simulated reads provided consistent AMR genotypes with the
               reference genomes. The MaSuRCA assembly of Staphylococcus aureus
               with real reads contained msr(A) and tet(K), while the reference
               genome and SPAdes and Unicycler assemblies harbored blaZ. The
               AMR genotypes of the reference genomes and hybrid assemblies
               were consistent for the other five antimicrobial-resistant
               strains with real reads. The numbers of virulence genes in all
               hybrid assemblies were similar to those of the reference
               genomes, irrespective of simulated or real reads. Only one
               exception existed that the reference genome and hybrid
               assemblies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with mediocre-quality long
               reads carried 241 virulence genes, whereas 184 virulence genes
               were identified in the hybrid assemblies of low-quality long
               reads. The MaSuRCA assemblies of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and
               Salmonella Typhimurium with mediocre-quality long reads
               contained 126 and 118 virulence genes, respectively, while 110
               and 107 virulence genes were detected in their MaSuRCA
               assemblies of low-quality long reads, respectively. All
               approaches performed well in our MLST and phylogenetic analyses.
               The pan genomes of the hybrid assemblies of S. Typhimurium with
               mediocre-quality long reads were similar to that of the
               reference genome, while SPAdes and Unicycler were more tolerant
               of low-quality long reads than MaSuRCA for the pan-genome
               analysis. All approaches functioned well in the pan-genome
               analysis of Campylobacter jejuni with real reads. CONCLUSIONS:
               Our research demonstrates the hybrid assembly pipeline of
               Unicycler as a superior approach for genomic analyses of
               bacterial pathogens using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore

% A review on all formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum
@ARTICLE{edel2019,

  abstract  = "The Fusarium oxysporum species complex includes both plant
               pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, which are commonly found
               in soils. F. oxysporum has received considerable attention from
               plant pathologists for more than a century owing to its broad
               host range and the economic losses it causes. The narrow host
               specificity of pathogenic strains has led to the concept of
               formae speciales, each forma specialis grouping strains with the
               same host range. Initially restricted to one plant species, this
               host range was later found to be broader for many formae
               speciales. In addition, races were identified in some formae
               speciales, generally with cultivar-level specialization. In
               1981, Armstrong and Armstrong listed 79 F. oxysporum formae
               speciales and mentioned races in 16 of them. Since then, the
               known host range of F. oxysporum has considerably increased, and
               many new formae speciales and races have been identified. We
               carried out a comprehensive search of the literature to propose
               this review of F. oxysporum formae speciales and races. We
               recorded 106 well-characterized formae speciales, together with
               37 insufficiently documented ones, and updated knowledge on
               races and host ranges. We also recorded 58 plant species/genera
               susceptible to F. oxysporum but for which a forma specialis has
               not been characterized yet. This review raises issues regarding

               concern in agriculture due to crop losses to contamination of
               cereal grains with mycotoxins. Fusarium species are also
               considered agents of human and animal mycotic infections, having
               a wide-ranging spectrum of clinical manifestations in
               immunocompromised patients. Fusarium phytopathogens infect a
               wide variety of plants and cause symptoms ranging from stunted
               growth, fruit or seed decay, yellowing, and wilting of the
               leaves and cankers to root or stem decay. The identification of
               these fungi is difficult due to their pleomorphic tendency and
               the presence of both homothallic and heterothallic strains in
               the same species, and so is identifying them at species level
               because of variation among isolates. However, molecular tools
               have so far been very powerful in species identification and
               phylogeny, as the great diversity of the Fusarium genus has
               compelled scientists to continuously revise previous taxons.
               Mostly, Fusarium diseases are difficult to control, as fungi
               easily overcome host resistance to various methods of control.

               its adverse effects, and its impacts on food security. We

% Explains how genes with related functionality tend to cluster together

               since their discovery, and many theories exist to explain their
               emergence, spreading, and evolutionary conservation. In this
               work, we suggest that DNA replication introduces a selective
               force for the clustering of functionally related genes on
               chromosomes, which we interpret as a preliminary and necessary
               step in operon formation. Our reasoning starts from the
               observation that DNA replication produces copy number variations
               of genomic regions, and we propose that such changes perturb
               metabolism. The formalization of this effect by exploiting
               concepts from metabolic control analysis suggests that the
               minimization of such perturbations during evolution could be
               achieved through the formation of gene clusters and operons. We
               support our theoretical derivations with simulations based on a
               realistic metabolic network, and we confirm that present-day
               genomes have a degree of compaction of functionally related
               genes, which is significantly correlated to the proposed
               perturbations introduced by replication. The formation of
               clusters of functionally related genes in microbial genomes has
               puzzled microbiologists since their first discovery. Here, we
               suggest that replication, and the copy number variations due to
               the replisome passage, might play a role in the process through a
               perturbation in metabolite homeostasis. We provide theoretical
               support to this hypothesis, and we found that both simulations
               and genomic analysis support our hypothesis.",

               Specialized metabolites synthesized by these fungi are known to
               play key roles in the infection process, and to provide survival
               advantages inside and outside the host. However, systematic
               studies of the evolution of specialized metabolite-coding
               potential across Fusarium have been scarce. Here, we apply a
               combination of bioinformatic approaches to identify biosynthetic
               gene clusters (BGCs) across publicly available genomes from
               Fusarium, to group them into annotated families and to study
               gain/loss events of BGC families throughout the history of the
               genus. Comparison with MIBiG reference BGCs allowed assignment of
               29 gene cluster families (GCFs) to pathways responsible for the
               production of known compounds, while for 57 GCFs, the molecular
               products remain unknown. Comparative analysis of BGC repertoires
               using ancestral state reconstruction raised several new
               hypotheses on how BGCs contribute to Fusarium pathogenicity or
               host specificity, sometimes surprisingly so: for example, a gene
               cluster for the biosynthesis of hexadehydro-astechrome was
               identified in the genome of the biocontrol strain Fusarium
               oxysporum Fo47, while being absent in that of the tomato pathogen
               F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici. Several BGCs were also identified
               on supernumerary chromosomes; heterologous expression of genes
               for three terpene synthases encoded on the Fusarium poae
               supernumerary chromosome and subsequent GC/MS analysis showed
               that these genes are functional and encode enzymes that each are
               able to synthesize koraiol; this observed functional redundancy
               supports the hypothesis that localization of copies of BGCs on
               supernumerary chromosomes provides freedom for evolutionary
               innovations to occur, while the original function remains
               conserved. Altogether, this systematic overview of biosynthetic
               diversity in Fusarium paves the way for targeted natural product
               discovery based on automated identification of species-specific

               has become an integral part of natural product discovery. The
               >200,000 microbial genomes now publicly available hold
               information on abundant novel chemistry. One way to navigate
               this vast genomic diversity is through comparative analysis of
               homologous BGCs, which allows identification of cross-species
               patterns that can be matched to the presence of metabolites or
               biological activities. However, current tools are hindered by a
               bottleneck caused by the expensive network-based approach used
               to group these BGCs into gene cluster families (GCFs). RESULTS:
               Here, we introduce BiG-SLiCE, a tool designed to cluster massive
               numbers of BGCs. By representing them in Euclidean space,
               BiG-SLiCE can group BGCs into GCFs in a non-pairwise,
               near-linear fashion. We used BiG-SLiCE to analyze 1,225,071 BGCs
               collected from 209,206 publicly available microbial genomes and
               metagenome-assembled genomes within 10 days on a typical 36-core
               CPU server. We demonstrate the utility of such analyses by
               reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity
               across taxonomy to identify uncharted biosynthetic potential.
               BiG-SLiCE also provides a ``query mode'' that can efficiently
               place newly sequenced BGCs into previously computed GCFs, plus a
               powerful output visualization engine that facilitates
               user-friendly data exploration. CONCLUSIONS: BiG-SLiCE opens up
               new possibilities to accelerate natural product discovery and
               offers a first step towards constructing a global and searchable
               interconnected network of BGCs. As more genomes are sequenced
               from understudied taxa, more information can be mined to

% History of Fusarium oxysporum and the Panama disease

  abstract  = "Banana (Musa spp.) is one of the world's most important fruits.
               In 2011, 145 million metric tons, worth an estimated \$44
               billion, were produced in over 130 countries. Fusarium wilt
               (also known as Panama disease) is one of the most destructive
               diseases of this crop. It devastated the 'Gros Michel'-based
               export trades before the mid-1900s, and threatens the Cavendish
               cultivars that were used to replace it; in total, the latter
               cultivars are now responsible for approximately 45\% of all
               production. An overview of the disease and its causal agent,
               Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, is presented below. Despite a
               substantial positive literature on biological, chemical, or
               cultural measures, management is largely restricted to excluding
               F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense from noninfested areas and using
               resistant cultivars where the pathogen has established.
               Resistance to Fusarium wilt is poor in several breeding targets,
               including important dessert and cooking cultivars. Better
               resistance to this and other diseases is needed. The history and
               impact of Fusarium wilt is summarized with an emphasis on
               tropical race 4 (TR4), a 'Cavendish'-killing variant of the
               pathogen that has spread dramatically in the Eastern Hemisphere.",

              required for the fungus to grow or develop but may be beneficial
              to the organism. An analysis of ten genomes from fungi within the
              terminal clade (clade 3) of the FSSC revealed each genome encoded
              35 (F. cucurbitcola) to 48 (F. tenucristatum) secondary
              metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). A total of

               methods has revolutionized the study of human bacterial
               pathogens and improved vaccine design. Unfortunately, the
               sequence of a single genome does not reflect how genetic
               variability drives pathogenesis within a bacterial species and
               also limits genome-wide screens for vaccine candidates or for

               resolve genomic structure. This has major implications for
               tracking the spread of mobile genetic elements, including those
               which carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully
               resolving a bacterial genome requires long-read sequencing such
               as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)

               sequence 12 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a single flow

               high coverage of the genome by short reads at a low cost, which
               has prompted development of new assembly methods. In particular,
               multiple algorithms based on de Bruijn graphs have been shown to
               be effective for the assembly problem. In this article, we
               describe a new hybrid approach that has the computational
               efficiency of de Bruijn graph methods and the flexibility of
               overlap-based assembly strategies, and which allows variable
               read lengths while tolerating a significant level of sequencing
               error. Our method transforms large numbers of paired-end reads
               into a much smaller number of longer 'super-reads'. The use of
               super-reads allows us to assemble combinations of Illumina reads

               Sanger sequencing technologies, making it one of the few
               assemblers capable of handling such mixtures. We call our system

               of MaSuRCA against two of the most widely used assemblers for
               Illumina data, Allpaths-LG and SOAPdenovo2, on two datasets from
               organisms for which high-quality assemblies are available: the
               bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides and chromosome 16 of the mouse
               genome. We show that MaSuRCA performs on par or better than
               Allpaths-LG and significantly better than SOAPdenovo on these
               data, when evaluated against the finished sequence. We then show
               that MaSuRCA can significantly improve its assemblies when the
               original data are augmented with long reads. AVAILABILITY:
               MaSuRCA is available as open-source code at
               ftp://ftp.genome.umd.edu/pub/MaSuRCA/. Previous
               (pre-publication) releases have been publicly available for over
               a year. CONTACT: alekseyz@ipst.umd.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY
